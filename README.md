# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Movement Prediction

## Overview
This project is designed to predict the daily movement of stock pricesâ€”specifically, whether the closing price will increase (Up) or decrease (Down) the next day. The pipeline includes data collection, feature engineering to compute technical indicators, model training with XGBoost, and evaluation using accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

*Note: For development and testing purposes, dummy data is used to simulate stock market data. The pipeline is structured to easily switch to real data from Yahoo Finance once API rate-limiting issues are resolved.*

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **yfinance** â€“ For fetching historical stock data (to be used when rate limits are resolved).
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ For data splitting, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **XGBoost** â€“ Machine learning model used for prediction.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ For data visualization (confusion matrix, plots, etc.).
- **Logging** â€“ To track and debug the pipeline's execution.

## Data Collection & Preprocessing
The project is designed to work with data containing the following columns:
- **Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume**

For now, dummy data is generated using the following structure:
- A date range starting from 2020-01-01.
- Randomly generated values for stock prices (`Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`) and `Volume`.

### Feature Engineering
The pipeline computes several technical indicators:
- **Moving Averages (MA5, MA10, MA50)**
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA12, EMA26)**
- **Daily Returns and Volatility**
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
- **MACD and Signal Line**
- **Bollinger Bands and Bollinger Band Width**
- **Volume Moving Average (Volume_MA10)**
- **Momentum (5-day percentage change)**
- **Lag Features for both Close and Volume (lag 1, 2, and 3 days)**
- **Target Variable:** Binary indicator (1 if next day's close > today's close, else 0).

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Stock-Price-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the main script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

*Note: The current setup uses dummy data. To switch to real data, uncomment the relevant data collection code in `main.py` and ensure you resolve any API rate limit issues with Yahoo Finance.*

## Model Evaluation
The project uses XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning via grid search and time-series cross-validation. The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualized with Seaborn heatmaps.
- **Classification Report:** Providing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

Example output on dummy data:
- **Accuracy:** ~73%
- **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report:** Displayed in the console and as a plot.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Real Data Integration:** Resolve rate-limiting issues with Yahoo Finance or use an alternative data provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud) to fetch real stock data.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Experiment with additional hyperparameters or alternative models (e.g., LSTM networks) to improve performance.
- **Deployment:** Consider deploying the model as an API using Flask/FastAPI or building a dashboard with Streamlit or Dash for live predictions.
- **Documentation & Testing:** Expand unit tests and documentation for each module to improve maintainability and facilitate future development.
